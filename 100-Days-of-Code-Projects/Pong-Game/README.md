Pong Game 🏓

Classic 2-player Pong Game implemented in Python using the turtle graphics module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

🎮 Description

Two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
Each time the ball hits a paddle:

The ball bounces back

Ball speed slightly increases

Scores are updated for each missed hit

The game continues until you close the window. Scores are displayed on screen in real-time.

✨ Features

Object-Oriented Design (Paddle, Ball, Scoreboard classes)

Smooth ball movement with speed acceleration on paddle hits

Score tracking for both players

Collision detection with walls and paddles

Keyboard controls for two players

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

Python OOP (classes, methods, modularization)

Graphics programming with turtle

Event-driven programming with keyboard input

Collision detection and movement logic

Game loop management and real-time updates
